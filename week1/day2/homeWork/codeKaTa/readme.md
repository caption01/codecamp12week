Question:

	- check different word (match with character and position).
	

code concept:

	- turn string into array.
    - pull array one by one (keep value in new parameter) to check if it match resultnumber + 1. 
    - where we pull array it effect to array lenght so use this behavior to run our code by.
    (while condition....... if array lenght = 0 it mean we finish loop.....if not...keep code running).
